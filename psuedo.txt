function BACKTRACKING-SEARCH(csp) -> a solution or failure:
  return BACKTRACK(csp, {})

function BACKTRACK(csp, assignment) -> solution or failure:
  if assignment is complete:
    return assignment
  
  var = SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE(csp, assignment)

  for each value in ORDER-DOMAIN-VALUES(csp, var, assignment):
    if value is consistent with assignment:
      add{var = value} to assignment

      inferences = INFERENCE(csp, var, assignment)

      if inferences != failure:
        add inferences to csp
        
        result = BACKTRACK(csp, assignment)

        if result != failure:
          return result
        
        remove inferences from csp
      remove {var=value} from assignment
  return failure

SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE should always pick next zone VARIABLE

ORDER-DOMAIN-VALUES should order ALL POSSIBLE domain values alphabetically

INFERENCE outcome is going to be based on previous zone variable assignment
